Angular Quiz Demo
=======================

This was an angular application I put together to do sample quizzes at a conference series.

I'm certainly not an Angular expert, and I learned a lot while on this project. Don't assume the code is good.

You can run the quiz, but the leaderboard will not work since I removed my personal keys.
